~~What do you call a teddy that is not a bear?~~

The inspiration for this color palette comes from a plush rabbit that was laying around the house.
It was a little Yellow Bunny with a White Tummy, Orange Bowtie and Pink Nose.

What will you make with this palette?

Sorry I didn't feel like making a little yellow bunny.
I thought these colors looked good on shapes
