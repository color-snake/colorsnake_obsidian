I created a webpage that generates 12 random color pairs every time you visit it or click the load more button. You can view it on Codepen https://codepen.io/thesunshiningdev/pen/YzMjVPo.
I personally have only created 8 different color pairs myself, over the last few months, now this webpages makes it easy to generate hundreds. Same with color palettes, I could probably create a webpages that creates random color palettes, but then that would take the human touch out of them.
