What makes a good color palette? I created color snake as a way to share palettes that I create and use for personal design projects. Maybe as I create and share more color palettes, I will be able to answer this question. I used the light yellow and white from this color palette for text and the other colors where primarily for the background, but I can't help but wonder if I should have used other colors for the text.
