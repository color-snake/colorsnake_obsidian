# How to name color palettes.

My personal palettes get their names from projects I am working on.
But the bigger question is how do I organize color palettes.

## Palette Naming for Organization
- Palette 0001 (And so forth for my palettes)
- Film 0001 (and so forth for palettes from films, sometimes more than one palette.)
- **Still trying to come up with a name for palettes from others**
- User Palette 0001 ?
- Artist Palette 0001 ?
- Designer Palette 0001 ?
- Thinking of spotlighting other artist and designers.
- Palette Spotlight 0001 (there may be more than one palette for a spotlight)
- Or maybe just use my Palette 000 name?
