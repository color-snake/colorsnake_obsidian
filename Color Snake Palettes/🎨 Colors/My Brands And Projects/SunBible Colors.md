From the app:
```palette
#ffc8c8
#FFFDD0
#ffffff
#ff6347
```

Light Red, White, and Tomato Red! I feel like I want to introduce the cream yellow to the app.


For Instagram:
```palette
#FFDE59
#FF5757
```
Don't ask me how I ended up with a different shade of red.

Logo red bg color: F94B4C
```palette
